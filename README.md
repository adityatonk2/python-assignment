Python Assignment: Basic Commands and List Functions
This assignment focuses on the fundamental concepts of Python, particularly basic commands and the use of list functions. We begin with essential Python commands, covering variables, basic data types, and simple control structures like loops and conditionals.

The core part of the assignment is dedicated to Python lists, a versatile data structure. The tasks include:

Creating lists and accessing elements using indexing
Modifying lists, such as adding or removing elements
Using common list methods like append(), insert(), remove(), sort(), and reverse()
Slicing lists to access a subset of elements
Iterating over lists with loops for efficient data manipulation
By completing the assignment, students will build a strong foundation in working with lists in Python and applying basic programming concepts effectively.
